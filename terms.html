                            transactions. As a result, and as discussed in more detail in these Terms, you hereby
                            acknowledge and agree that JAGMUL is not a party to such transactions, has no control over
                            any element of such transactions, and shall have no liability to any party in connection

                            communication, whether through the Platform or another Third Party Website (defined below)
                            or offerings, comments, user postings, files, images, photos, video, sounds, business
                            listings/information and directory information or any other material made available through
                            the Platform and the Service ("Content"), and that by using the Platform and the Service,
                            you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or

                            evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, that you may not rely
                            on said Content, and that under no circumstances will JAGMUL be liable in any way for the
                            Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the browsing, using or

                            that JAGMUL has the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to refuse, delete or move
                            any Content that is or may be available through the Service, for violating these Terms and
                            such violation being brought to OLX’s knowledge or for any other reason or no reason at all.

                            accuracy or authenticity of the information contained in any such Third Party Website, and
                            your linking to any other websites is completely at your own risk and JAGMUL disclaims all

                        <p>You can either purchase a single Paid ad or can avail of bulk packages (“Paid ads package”)
                            based on your requirement which shall be provided to you at a discounted price as mentioned
                            on the Website.</p>
                        <p> The validity of Paid ads: </p>
                        <p>• Limited Paid ads package – In the Limited Paid ads package, you can post a limited number
                            of ads during the validity of the package. Paid ads in this package shall each be valid for
                            30 days from the date of posting regardless of when it is posted by you during the life of

                            package.</p>
                        <p>Payment for Paid Services</p>
                        <p>Upon selecting any feature of Paid Services, you may be redirected to a third-party payment
                            processing site such as RazorPay offering payment through various channels such as net
                            banking, debit card and credit card (“Payment Gateway”). JAGMUL may offer you a right to pay
                            through cash or other channels such as cash collection. You agree that Paid Services will be
                            made available to you only upon receipt of payment confirmation from the Payment Gateway or
                            collection agencies. Upon making payment to us, through any medium whatsoever, you warrant
                            to us that you are entitled to use the medium or otherwise make the payment to us under
                            applicable law.</p>
                        <p>You have the ability to provide us your Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN)
                            on the platform. Your GSTIN details are mandatory for passing on the credit of GST charged.
                            In case you fail to provide us with your GSTIN details, we will assume that you are not
                            registered with the GST authorities, without independently verifying your registration
                            status.</p>
                        <p>Unless otherwise mentioned on the Website, prices indicated are inclusive of applicable
                            taxes.</p>
                        <p>Refunds/Cancellation </p>
                        <p>If you choose to delete or deactivate any Paid Services prior to the period for which it is
                            active, we will not be liable to refund you for any unutilized time. In the event you are
                            not able to avail of the Paid Services on the Website on account of any technical reasons,
                            on receipt of payment confirmation, equivalent units of the paid feature against the ad
                            units you were not able to post shall be credited to your account. For example, if you buy a
                            package of 3 Featured Ad units out of which you have consumed only 2 units and were unable
                            to post the remaining 1 ad unit as a Featured Ad on account of a technical glitch during the
                            lifetime of the package validity, you will be credited only 1 unit of Featured Ad to your
                            account.</p>
                        <p>The above refund policy shall not be applicable in the event any content in your
                            advertisement is found to be violating the Terms or there has been any abuse reported in
                            relation to your advertisement or your advertisement is deleted or not re-posted on the
                            Website on account of any technical reasons due to any subsequent editing done by you.</p>
                        <p>v. POSTING AGENTS</p>
                        <p>As used herein, the term "Posting Agent" refers to a third-party agent, service, or
                            intermediary that offers to post Content to the Service on behalf of others. JAGMUL
                            prohibits the use of Posting Agents, directly or indirectly, without the express written
                            permission of JAGMUL. In addition, Posting Agents are not permitted to post Content on
                            behalf of others, directly or indirectly, or otherwise access the Service in order to post
                            Content on behalf of others, except with express written permission or license from JAGMUL.
                        </p>
                        <p> vi. ACCESS TO THE SERVICEGo to top</p>
                        <p>JAGMUL grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to access and use the Service
                            for personal use. This license granted herein does not include any of the following: (a)
                            access to or use of the Service by Posting Agents; or (b) any collection, aggregation,
                            copying, duplication, display, or derivative use of the Service nor any use of data mining,
                            robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and extraction tools for any purpose unless
                            expressly permitted by JAGMUL or as otherwise set forth in these Terms. Notwithstanding the
                            foregoing, general purpose internet search engines and non-commercial public archives that
                            gather information for the sole purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Service, provided
                            they each do so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses using an easily
                            identifiable agent and comply with our robots.txt file, may engage in the activities set
                            forth in (b). For purposes of this exception, a "general purpose internet search engine"
                            does not include a website or search engine or other services that specializes in classified
                            listings including any subset of classifieds listings such as housing, for sale, jobs,
                            services, or personals, or which otherwise provides classified ad listing services. The
                            license set forth in this Section permits you to display on your website, or create a
                            hyperlink thereto, individual postings on the Service so long as such use is for
                            non-commercial and/or news reporting purposes only (e.g., for use in personal blogs or other
                            personal online media). If the total number of such postings displayed on or linked to your
                            website exceeds limits set by JAGMUL, your use will be considered to be in violation of
                            these Terms, unless JAGMUL expressly grants you permission otherwise. You are also permitted
                            to create a hyperlink to the home page of the Platform so long as the link does not portray
                            JAGMUL, its employees, affiliates, or agents in a false, confusing, misleading, derogatory,
                            or otherwise offensive matter. Use of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access as
                            set forth in these Terms immediately terminates any permission or license granted herein. In
                            order to collect, aggregate, copy, duplicate, display or make derivative use of the Service
                            or any Content made available via the Service for other purposes (including commercial
                            purposes) not stated herein, you must first obtain a license from JAGMUL.</p>

                            in civil life and practice. You affirm that you are either at least 18 years of age, or an
                            emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent and are fully able and

                        <p>These Terms and the other policies posted on the Platform constitute the complete and
                            exclusive understanding and agreement between you and JAGMUL and govern your use of the
                            Service and the Platform superseding all prior understandings, proposals, agreements,
                            negotiations, and discussions between the parties, whether written or oral. The Terms and
                            the relationship between you and JAGMUL shall be governed by the laws of the India. Any
                            claim you may have against JAGMUL must be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
                            courts of Kerala, India. However, in the event that you are a consumer, it may be that
                            consumer law requires that another law is applicable and that a claim may be submitted to
                            another jurisdiction. The failure of JAGMUL to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
                            the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the
                            Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid (including, without
                            limitation, because such provision is inconsistent with the laws of another jurisdiction) or
                            inapplicable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect
                            to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision. If any provision or provisions of
                            these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and
                            enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Terms shall not in any way be affected or
                            be impaired. YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION BROUGHT BY YOU AND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
                            TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AND/OR THE PLATFORM MUST COMMENCE WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME AND IN
                            ANY EVENT WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, EXCEPT THAT JAGMUL MAY
                            COMMENCE ANY SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
                            UNDER INDIAN LAW. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED. These Terms shall
                            inure to the benefit of and be binding upon each party's successors and assigns.</p>

                        <p>Please report any violations of the Terms that you become aware of by contacting us using the
                            link at the bottom of the JAGMUL homepage at www.Jagmul.in. Any failure to act by JAGMUL
                            with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to
                            subsequent or similar breaches by you or others. You understand and agree that, because
                            damages are often difficult or impossible to quantify, if actual damages cannot be
                            reasonably calculated then you will be liable to pay JAGMUL the following as liquidated
                            damages (and not a penalty):</p>
                        <p>A) If JAGMUL establishes any limits on the frequency with which you may access the Service,
                            or terminates your access to or use of the Service, you agree to pay JAGMUL ninety-nine
                            euros (€99) for (i) each message posted in excess of such limits or (ii) for each day on
                            which you access JAGMUL in excess of such limits, whichever is higher. <br>

                            B) If you are a Posting Agent that uses the Service in violation of these Terms, in addition
                            to any liquidated damages under Section xx(e) below you agree to pay JAGMUL INDIAninety-nine
                            euros (€99) for each and every item you post in violation of these Terms. A Posting Agent
                            will also be deemed an agent of the party engaging the Posting Agent to access the Service,
                            and such party (by engaging the Posting Agent in violation of these Terms) agrees to pay
                            JAGMUL an additional ninety-nine euros (€99) for each item posted by the Posting Agent on
                            behalf of such party in violation of these Terms.<br>

                            C) If you use JAGMUL e-mail addresses or computer systems to send unsolicited e-mail
                            advertisements to JAGMUL e-mail addresses or any other party, you agree to pay JAGMUL thirty
                            euros (€30) for each such e-mail.<br>

                            D) If you post messages in violation of these Terms, other than as described above, you
                            agree to pay JAGMUL ninety-nine euros (€99) for each such message. Notwithstanding the
                            foregoing, JAGMUL may, in its sole and absolute discretion, issue a warning before assessing
                            damages pursuant to this Section xx(e).<br>

                            E) If you aggregate, copy, display, mirror, reproduce, or otherwise exploit for any purpose
                            any Content (except for your own Content) in violation of these Terms without JAGMUL 's
                            express written permission, you agree to pay JAGMUL ten thousand euros (€10,000) for each
                            day on which you engage in such conduct.</p>
                        <p>If none of the foregoing clauses (a) – (f) are applicable, you agree to pay JAGMUL’s actual
                            damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Notwithstanding any
                            other provision of these Terms, JAGMUL retains the right to seek equitable remedies,
                            including without limitation, specific performance of any term contained in these Terms, or
                            a preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach or threatened breach of any such
                            term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in these Terms, or any combination
                            thereof, without the necessity of posting a bond.</p>

                            information, and language selection. Cookies may be used whether you register with us or
                            not. "Cookies" are small text files transferred by a web server to your hard drive and
                            thereafter stored on your computer. The types of information a cookie collects include the
                            date and time you visited, your browsing history, your preferences, and your username. In
                            some instances, our third-party service providers may use cookies on the Platform. We cannot
                            control or access cookies used by third-party service providers. This Privacy Policy covers
                            only Cookies used by us and not any cookies used by third parties. You have the ability to
                            either accept or decline the use of cookies on your computer, whether you are registered
                            with us or not. Typically, you can configure your browser to not accept cookies. However,
                            declining the use of cookies may limit your access to certain features of the Platform. For
                            example, you may have difficulty logging in or using certain interactive features of the
                            Platform, such as the JAGMUL Forum or Comments feature.</p>
                        <p>• D. Third Parties</p>
                        <p>We use third-party service providers to assist us in measuring purchases and sales on our
                            Platform and generally improving our Platform and monitoring our users’ interests and
                            activities. You hereby authorize JAGMUL and/or third-party service providers engaged by
                            JAGMUL to collect, use, store, analyse, reproduce, publish, and adapt (either on its own or
                            through a third-party service provider) the information in relation to your use of the
                            Platform for the purpose of data analysis and for improving your experience on the Platform.
                            In addition, the Platform may occasionally contain links to Third-Party Sites or provide you
                            with information in relation to services that you may avail from any third parties.
                            Information about services that you may choose to avail from these third-party service
                            providers may be actively provided to you by JAGMUL in any manner including through its
                            various marketing and communication channels. You acknowledge that this is solely undertaken
                            by JAGMUL to improve your experience in relation to the use of the Platform and the
                            provision of such services shall be subject to such additional terms and conditions of
                            JAGMUL and/or third-party service providers. JAGMUL may also offer for free or for a fee,
                            deliverables produced by third-party service providers in furtherance of any services that
                            you may have availed from these third-party service providers in connection with the
                            advertisement posted on the Platform, without any obligation (monetary or otherwise) towards
                            you. JAGMUL shall not be responsible for any service availed by you from such third parties
                            or any payment made by you to such third parties in connection with the services. Any
                            concern or claims in relation to such services should be directed by you to such third
                            parties. If you click on the links to Third-Party Websites, you leave the Platform. We are
                            not responsible for the content of these Third-Party Websites or for the security of your
                            personal information when you use the Third-Party Websites. These third-party service
                            providers and Third-Party Sites may have their own privacy policies governing the storage
                            and retention of your personal information that you may be subject to. They may collect
                            information such as your IP address, browser specification, or operating system. This
                            Privacy Policy does not govern personal information provided to, stored on, or used by these
                            third-party providers and Third-Party Sites. We recommend that when you enter a Third-Party
                            Site, you review the Third Party Site’s privacy policy as it relates to safeguarding your
                            personal information. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit
                            the Platform. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email
                            address, or telephone number) about your visits to the Platform and Third-Party Websites in
                            order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. On the
                            Platform, Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads. Google’s use of the
                            DoubleClick DART Cookie enables it to serve ads to the Platform’s users based on their visit
                            to the Platform and Third-Party Websites. For more information on the DART Cookie see
                            http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html. You may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by
                            Google by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network Privacy Policy at
                            http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html. You may opt-out of targeting advertising for all NAI
                            member ad networks by visiting: http://www.networkadvertising.org/. By publishing an ad on
                            the Platform, you acknowledge and agree that the Content is public and accessible by any
                            third party and that it may appear in search engine results (such as Yahoo!, MSN, Google,
                            Altavista, and other search engines) and in the cache of those search engines, in feeds and
                            Third-Party Websites pursuant to co-branding agreements, and that it is the sole
                            responsibility of each of those search engines, Third-Party Websites or RSS web feed
                            resources to update and/or to remove Content from their indexes and their cache. You agree
                            and acknowledge that JAGMUL is not liable for the information published in search results or
                            by any Third-Party Website that carries JAGMUL postings.</p>
                        <p>• E. How Your Information is Used </p>
                        <p>We may use the information provided by you to: (i) enforce our Terms of Use, monitor user
                            activity, such as keyword searches or new postings, and more effectively manage traffic on
                            the Platform; (ii) provide customer services, create and manage user accounts; and (iii)
                            assist you with technical difficulties. Also, we may share with third-party service
                            providers certain information, such as your browser capabilities or operating system, that
                            we have collected in order to better understand which advertisements and services may
                            interest you. We may block users located in certain countries from using the Platform. We
                            may retain such information for as long as is required to fulfil our business objective,
                            even after your account is terminated.</p>
                        <p>• F. Protecting Your Personal Information </p>
                        <p>You are a valued customer, and we recognize that protecting your privacy is important to you.
                            For this reason, we are committed to protecting the personal information you provide in a
                            variety of ways. We do not directly process any payments and do not store your credit card
                            information. Secured socket layer ("SSL") technology is used for processing payment
                            transactions with third-party service provider partners, such as RazorPay. Your Registration
                            Information may be protected by a unique customer password and user ID. You should not
                            disclose your password information to anyone and you should always remember to log off if
                            using a shared computer. Lastly, you may utilize the Platform as an anonymous user by not
                            registering. We have taken certain security protections in safeguarding your personal
                            information. However, as with most electronic transactions, no method is 100% safe. While we
                            strive to use a commercially acceptable means to protect the personal information you
                            provide, we cannot guarantee its security. Therefore, you acknowledge and agree that we
                            assume no liability regarding the theft, loss, alteration or misuse of personal or other
                            information or Content, including, without limitation, such information that has been
                            provided to third parties or other users, or with regards to the failure of a third party to
                            abide by the agreement between us and such third party. You may participate in our Forum or
                            utilize our Comments feature. For postings to the Forum, your username will be posted. For
                            postings using the Comments feature, your name and email will only be posted if you provide
                            it in the comment. We strongly discourage posting any information on these features or in
                            any Content posted by you that you do not want others to see. You agree that you are
                            responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password, and all uses
                            of your account, whether or not you have authorized such use.</p>
                        <p>• G. Accessing and Modifying Personal Information and Communication Preferences </p>
                        <p>You may access, remove, review, and/or make changes to the personal information that you have
                            provided to us via the Contact Support form. You need not register in order to post or
                            respond to advertisements on the Platform. If you register or respond to advertisements or
                            posts on the Platform or post any content on the Platform, we may send you certain
                            notifications, advertisements, promotions, surveys, text messages, specials, and phone calls
                            in relation to the Services.. We may also send you any legally required notifications and
                            certain notifications, including but not limited to, service-related notices or notices
                            regarding a change to any of our policies. For example, we may send you a notice regarding
                            server problems or scheduled maintenance to the Platform. In order to opt-out of receiving
                            these notices, you may need to deactivate your account. You can opt-out of certain e-mail
                            communications from us, including our newsletters, advice on buying and selling on the
                            Platform, notifications that a user has commented on your posting, and notifications that
                            you can refresh your posting. We will not change your preferences without your consent. You
                            cannot opt-out of receiving transactional communications from JAGMUL related to your
                            account.</p>
                        <p>• H. Disclosures </p>
                        <p>On rare occasions, we may be required to disclose your personal information due to legal or
                            regulatory requirements. In such instances, we reserve the right to disclose your personal
                            information as required in order to comply with our legal obligations, including but not
                            limited to complying with court orders, warrants, subpoenas, service of process
                            requirements, or discovery requests. We may also disclose information about our users to law
                            enforcement officers or others, in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably
                            necessary to enforce these Terms and/or Privacy Policy; respond to claims that any Content
                            violates the rights of third-parties; or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of
                            JAGMUL, our users or the general public; or we are in notice of any criminal activity being
                            conducted via the Platform. You agree and acknowledge that we may not inform you prior to or
                            after disclosures made according to this section. If substantially all of our assets are
                            sold or merged into another company, the acquiring company shall be given access to your
                            personal information without your consent. If we sell only a part of our business, the
                            acquiring entity shall have access to your personal information without your consent and we
                            may send you a notice regarding this sale.</p>
                        <p>• Notification of Changes </p>
                        <p>We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time, and at our sole discretion. We
                            may send you a notice regarding material changes to these Terms, including the Privacy
                            Policy or the Platform. You should make note of the "last updated date" at the beginning of
                            the Terms. With this information, you should be able to identify if the Terms have been
                            updated recently.</p>
                        <p>• J. Disputes </p>
