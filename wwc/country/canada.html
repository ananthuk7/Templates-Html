        <p class="text-justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose to study in Canada, and you’ll
            have the opportunity
            to encounter vastly different cultural and
            natural experiences – from the ski slopes of British Columbia to the prairie province of Manitoba, with
            cities such as Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver and Quebec famously friendly, tolerant and multicultural.

            Occupying the northern half of the North American continent, Canada is known for its natural beauty – few
            nations in the world can boast anything close to its wealth of forests, lakes and mountains – and for
            its multicultural diversity. The country has official bilingual status, with English and French used
            concurrently in government and official documents.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also known for its sparse
            population (despite being the
            world’s second-largest country, it has a
            population smaller than that of just one US state, California) and for its harsh winters. In some parts
            of Canada, snow covers the ground for almost half the year.

            Canada has a well-established position among the world’s leading study destinations. The most popular
            Canadian provinces for international students are Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec, which between
            them are home to many of the top universities in Canada.

        <p class="text-justify">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multicultural Canada is one of the world’s best destinations
            for migrants. Its cosmopolitan cities, a
            stable economy and high quality of life make it one of the best countries to live in. Canada also has a
            huge demand for migrants and has opened its doors to individuals with the skills and talent to give it a
            global edge.

        <h3>WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO APPLY TO CANADA?
        </h3>
        <p class="text-justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While each program to migrate to Canada
            has different criteria, there are a few things in common.
            Canadian immigration officials will typically assess migration applications based on:
        </p>
        <ul class="senta ul">
            <li class="li">Educational profile
            </li>
            <li class="li">Professional profile
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                Your IELTS score
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                French language skills if migrating to Quebec
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                References & legal documentation
            </li>
            <li class="li">Canadian employment documentation
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an exhaustive list and
            subject to change. Talk to a WWC counsellor to assess your eligibility
            and increase your chances of migrating to Canada.
