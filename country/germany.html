            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study in Germany, Land of Ideas - Germany is a country of diverse landscapes and exciting cities. Its
            economy is the largest in Europe and the fifth largest in the world. Many pioneering inventions come from
            Germany. Science and research have a long tradition and are highly valued today. Since opening its doors to
            immigrants in the 1960s, Germany has become a land of immigration. Germany is a cosmopolitan and tolerant
            country.

            one trillion euros. Most of Germany’s exports are products made for the areas of electrical engineering,
            mechatronics, heavy machinery, the automotive industry, environmental technology, pharmaceuticals and
            chemicals. Consumers around the world recognise “Made in Germany” as a seal of quality. Germany is home to
            many trusted and renowned market leaders, such as Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Bayer, Siemens and many others.
